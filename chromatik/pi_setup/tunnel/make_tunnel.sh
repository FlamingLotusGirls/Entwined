###  script so that you can ssh to any entwined pi that has internet access using a reverse ssh tunnel
###  each pi sets up a tunnel using 950arnold.ddns.net as the remote server
###  each pi has to have a dedicated name, and ssh port defined in ports.json and saved to git
###  only use ports from 9070-9090
###  we are using the remote server 950arnold.ddns.net which is always on the internet and accessible remotely 
###  as our ssh tunnel gateway
